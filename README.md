# django-data-relay

The **django-data-relay** is a web application designed to serve as a bridge between front-end and back-end systems, facilitating seamless data transfer between applications. Built with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), a free and open-source Python web framework, the **django-data-relay** can collect, aggregate, and provide data from various sources to different destinations in a rapid and scalable fashion. The **django-data-relay** offers a core setup that can be utilized as a template and expanded upon as necessary.

> [!WARNING]
> ⚠️ The **django-data-relay** not suitable for production use - it runs on Django's lightweight development server, which is intended solely for development purposes. For more information, refer to the [Django documentation](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/ref/django-admin/#runserver). Configuring a production server is beyond the scope of this project.

## 🌱 Abstract

The **django-data-relay** acts as an intermediary that receives data from one source and forwards it to another, ensuring that data flows smoothly between different systems. Leveraging Django's comprehensive toolkit, the **django-data-relay** can [simultaneously]() interface with [different database systems]() and provide data, resources, and services to multiple applications. Other key features include:

- ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for interacting with databases using Python code instead of SQL queries.
- A ready-to-use admin interface for managing application data.
- Built-in security features, including an authentication system for managing accounts and permissions.
- A rich ecosystem of third-party packages and libraries.
- A large and active community for resources and support.

## 💡 Use Cases

Django is well known and well-suited for building complex and robust web applications. As such, the **django-data-relay** harnesses Django's powerful built-in features to support a diverse range of applications and services. Examples include:

- APIs and web services
- Content Management Systems (CMS)
- Data-driven applications
- E-commerce platforms
- Social Network platforms
- Booking and Reservation systems

> [!NOTE]
> Django is considered an opinionated framework, meaning it promotes a set of conventions and best practices to help developers structure and standardize their applications efficiently.
