## ðŸŒ± Abstract

The **django-data-relay** is designed to serve as a bridge between various data sources and destinations, facilitating the transfer of data between them. Django, a free and open source Python web framework, was selected for this project because it provides a comprehensive toolkit for the rapid development of robust and scalable applications. Some of these out-of-the-box features include:

- Support for connecting to an assortment of different databases.
- A ready-to-use admin interface for managing application data.
- ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) for interacting with databases using Python code instead of using SQL queries.
- Useful security features including an authentication system for managing accounts and permissions.
- A large and active community for resources and support.

## ðŸ’¡ Use Cases

Django is well known and well-suited for building complex and robust web applications. As such, the **django-data-relay** leverages django's powerful built-in features to support a wide variety of applications and services. Some examples include:

- APIs and web services
- Content Management Systems (CMS)
- Data-driven applications
- E-commerce platforms
- Social Network platforms
- Booking and Reservation systems

> Note: Django is considered an opinionated framework, meaning it is intended to be used alongside a set of conventions and best practices to structure and standardize applications.
